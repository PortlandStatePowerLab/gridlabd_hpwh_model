==> SuiteSparse_config - extracted from source code:

    SuiteSparse_config, 2021, Timothy A. Davis, http://www.suitesparse.com
    (formerly the UFconfig package)
    
    This directory contains a default SuiteSparse_config.mk file.  It tries to
    detect your system (Linux, SunOS, or Mac), which compiler to use (icc or cc),
    which BLAS and LAPACK library to use (Intel MKL is strongly preferred), and
    whether or not to compile with CUDA.
    
    For alternatives, see the comments in the SuiteSparse_config.mk file.
    
    License: No licensing restrictions apply to this file or to the
    SuiteSparse_config directory.
    
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    SuiteSparse_config contains configuration settings for all many of the software
    packages that I develop or co-author.  Note that older versions of some of
    these packages do not require SuiteSparse_config.
